# fedora-oci-images

My (very experimental) OCI images derived from Fedora's image-based desktops

## Changes from stock images

* Adds `podman-compose`
* Removes `gnome-software` and `firefox`
* Sets automatic weekly system upgrades
* Adds an optional service that updates user-installed flatpaks weekly
